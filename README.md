My project is a platform designed for people to learn music theory. I hope to add a synthesizer module to the website, as well as design a frontend for the entire application

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
Client side JS is something ive never done before.
Making sure there is minimal latency on press.
Modifying the parameters of each synth using input forms.

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.**
Working Midi keyboard and better landing page UI/UX

## Bike

**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use**
Turn Midi keyboard into programmable synth (buttons, knobs, faders(linear encoders) etc)

## Car

**ONE additional feature**
Create custom UI for synth to look more like a traditional synth emulation

## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**
